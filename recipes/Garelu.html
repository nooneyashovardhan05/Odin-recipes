        <p>Garelu Recipe is my ultimate comfort food and I can eat it any time, all the time. All I need is a bowl of delicious chutney to go with it and life is bliss.</p>
        <h4>Ingredients :</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cup urad dal / black split lentil</li>
            <li>3 medium sized onion finely sliced</li>
            <li>2-3 green chili / hari mirch finely chopped</li>
            <li>1 inch ginger / adrak finely chopped</li>
            <li>5-6 curry leaves / kadi patta finely chopped</li>
            <li>2 tbsp coriander leaves / cilnatro / hara dhaniya finely chopped</li>
            <li>salt to taste</li>
            <li>pinch of baking soda</li>
            <li>oil for deep frying</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Instructions :</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Wash and soak the urad dal for at least 2 hours.</li>
            <li>Drain the water from the soaked dal and then blend it in a grinder or food processor till a slightly coarse paste. It should not be very coarse too. Just how you would feel the semolina consistency. (You can make it smooth and fluffy paste if you like it that way.)</li>
            <li>Do not add too much water while blending the dal. If required just sprinkle some water.</li>
            <li>Transfer this paste to a large bowl and beat it well with your hand to create the aeration.</li>
            <li>Next add in the sliced onion, green chili, baking soda, chopped ginger, chopped curry leaves, chopped coriander leaves, salt and mix well.</li>
            <li>Heat oil. Press the garelu paste into a round disc, and make a small hole in the middle like a donut. You can skip making a hole too. (For easier working, dip your hand in water before taking the paste from the bowl, the garelu slips easily into the oil)</li>
            <li>Slide the prepared discs directly into the hot oil and cook on medium heat till golden brown in color. Serve hot with some coconut chutney or sambar.</li>
        </ol>
